## Data Proposal (__10.23 Tues__)
* Form a group (up to 4 students) and select data set
  * No restriction on data set. However, business(fin/ma/econ) related data is welcome (extra credit for creative data selection and pre-processing)
* Create a designate repository `GITHUB_ID/PHBS_MLF_2018` for your team
  * Tick `Initialize this repository with a README` and select `python` under `.gitignore` 
  * Put team members (student # and github ID), brief description of data, and goal of the project in `README.md` (refer to [markdown cheetsheet](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
  * Put the data under `/data` folder (if too big, put some samples)
  * In lieu of submission, invite `jaehyukchoi` as a collaborator (under `Setting` > `Collaborators & teams`)
* In the class, use `README.md` for brief presentation (3 min per team)

## Project Guidline
* Report should be consist of the summary in `README.md` and the execusion in python notebooks `.ipynb`.  ( `.pdf`, `.ppt`, `.doc` __NOT__ accepted.)
* In the `README.md` summary, 
  * You may update your proposal file.
  * briefly describe your motivation, goal, data source, result and conclusion.
  * A few figure or table for summary is recommended.
  * Use links to data or `.ipynb` files (see past year examples below)
* In the `.ipynb` execusion, 
  * Put command cell and edit cell (comments) in a balanced way. (Do not only put code!)
  * Put a brief table of contents with links (example: __PML__)
  * You may breakdown code into several `.ipynb` files by function (e.g., data cleaning, learning, result analysis). In that case, make sure to __save__ intermediate result into file so that I can run the later steps (result analysis) without running previous steps (data cleaning, learning).
  * The use of `.py` file should be strictly restricted to function or class only. (Do not put any learning procedure in `.py`)
  * I should be able to reproduce the result from your code. Your code should run with no error. Code with error will be severely deduct your score. Make sure to run your code in a new session.
* Other considerations:
  * Make sure the workload within team is balanced. (Add your team members to collaborators, each team members committ codes, etc)
  * There should be no secret component (e.g., stock trading strategy)
  * Creativive (out-of-textbook) ideas are recommended for better result or result analysis
* Deadline for updating report is __11.13 Tues Midnight (11:59 PM)__
